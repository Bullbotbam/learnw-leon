//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ['The Last Dragon', 'Lost Boys', 'The Color Purple'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let firstMovie = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arraySize = movies.length;
console.log(arraySize);
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = movies[movies.length - 1];
